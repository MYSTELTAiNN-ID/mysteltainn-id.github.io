# Privacy Policy

Last updated: 27 November 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how Wuthering Challenger (“we”, “our”, or “the Developer”) handles information in Joyland.log (“the Game”).
The Game is fully offline, does not require an internet connection, and does not collect personal data.


## 1. Information We Collect

The Game does not collect, store, or process any personal information.
This includes:
- Name
- Email address
- Phone number
- Location data
- Online identifiers
- Advertising data
- Gameplay analytics
- IP address
- User account information

The Game does not use ads, analytics systems, or online services.

Unity Engine (Non-Personal Technical Data)

Because the Game is built using the Unity engine, Unity Technologies may automatically collect limited, non-personal technical data such as:
- Device model
- Operating system version
- Hardware characteristics
- Anonymous crash information

This data is collected and processed by Unity, not the Developer.
For more details, see Unity’s privacy policy.

## 2. Legal Basis (GDPR)

Since the Game does not collect personal data, the Developer does not perform any personal-data processing that requires a GDPR legal basis.

Unity’s processing of anonymous technical data is governed by Unity’s own legal basis.

## 3. How Data Is Used

The Developer does not collect or use any personal or non-personal data.
Any technical data collected by Unity is used solely by Unity for engine diagnostics and performance improvements.

## 4. Third-Party Services

The Game does not integrate with external online services.

The only third-party service involved is:
- Unity Technologies (engine-level anonymous data collection)

The Developer does not have access to this data.

## 5. Children’s Privacy

The Game does not collect personal information from any user, including children under 13 or under GDPR’s digital-consent ages (13–16 depending on the country).

## 6. Data Retention

The Game does not store any data.
Unity may retain anonymous technical data according to their own policies.

## 7. User Rights Under GDPR

Since the Developer does not collect personal data:
- There is no personal data to access, correct, delete, or restrict.
- GDPR rights apply only to data processed by Unity Technologies.

To exercise rights related to Unity’s engine-level data, users must refer to Unity’s privacy policy and contact Unity directly.

## 8. Data Controller

For developer-collected data:
Withering Challenger is the data controller.
However, since no personal data is collected, no actual processing takes place.

For Unity-collected data:
Unity Technologies is the data controller.

## 9. Contact

If you have questions about this policy, you may contact the Developer using:

or

## 10. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
Changes will be posted on https://mysteltainn-id.github.io.


Continued use of the Game after changes are posted means acceptance of the updated policy.
